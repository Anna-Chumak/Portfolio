      <StyledPar>
        I'm a Ukrainian-born software developer currently living in the Detroit
        Metropolitan Area.

      <StyledPar>
        I originally started learning foreign languages, like English and
        Italian, which resulted in me pursuing Teaching English as a Second
        Language as a career path.

        However, I've always had an interest in technology, as well as many
        family members already in the software engineering field, and eventually
        found that this was the career path I was meant for. I still get to work
        with languages, but in a different way. I started by learning C++, but
        have also spent time becoming proficient with other languages, like C#,
        JS and PHP.

      <StyledPar>
        When I'm not behind the computer, you'll usually find me working on
        puzzles, visiting theme parks, and hiking. ðŸ˜Š
